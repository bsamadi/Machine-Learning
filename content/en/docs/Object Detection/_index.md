## [Milestones in state-of-the-art Object Detection](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/object-detection/)
The field of object detection is not as new as it may seem. In fact, object detection has evolved over the past 20 years. The progress of object detection is usually separated into two separate historical periods (before and after the introduction of Deep Learning):

* Before 2014 – Traditional Object Detection period
  * Viola-Jones Detector (2001), the pioneering work that started the development of traditional object detection methods
  * HOG Detector (2006), a popular feature descriptor for object detection in computer vision and image processing
  * DPM (2008) with the first introduction of bounding box regression

* After 2014 – Deep Learning Detection period
  * Most important two-stage object detection algorithms
    * RCNN and SPPNet (2014)
    * Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN (2015)
    * Mask R-CNN (2017)
    * Pyramid Networks/FPN (2017)
    * G-RCNN (2021)

  * Most important one-stage object detection algorithms
    * YOLO (2016)
    * SSD (2016)
    * RetinaNet (2017)
    * YOLOv3 (2018)
    * YOLOv4 (2020)
    * YOLOR (2021)
