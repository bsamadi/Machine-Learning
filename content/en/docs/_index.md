Some of the methods have been implemented and you can find the implementation in Notebook tab.

Previous work showed that during training, DNNs tend to learn simple patterns first, then gradually memorize all samples [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394).
n recent years, deep learning has made impressive progress
in the classification task. The success of deep neural networks is based on the large scale datasets with a tremendous
amount of labeled samples (Deng et al. 2009).
However, in
many practical situations, a large number of labeled samples
are inaccessible.

For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which lives in the [Docsy theme repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide) if you'd like to copy its docs section. 

Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.

Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/). You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in [Organizing Your Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).
